/*Everything you can do with classes you can do with struct, the only differente is that the members of the strucs
are public by default whereas the members of a class are private by default.
In that sense, by using structs we usually don't use methods, as the information is already public (no need for get_name).
On top of that, there's no other difference between classes and structs. We can set them to operate as the other one defining
the public and private statements, but is a good practice to use them coherently*/
